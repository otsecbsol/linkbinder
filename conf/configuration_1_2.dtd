   Used to store metadata in the Checkstyle configuration file. This
   information is ignored by Checkstyle. This may be useful if you want to
   store plug-in specific information.

   To avoid name clashes between different tools/plug-ins you are *strongly*
   encouraged to prefix all names with your domain name. For example, use the
   name "com.mycompany.parameter" instead of "parameter".

   The prefix "com.puppycrawl." is reserved for Checkstyle.
